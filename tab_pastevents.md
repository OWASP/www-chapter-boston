### Oct 2023 Chapter Meeting
#### The Dark Side of Open Source Productivity . Matt Brown

Hybrid Attendance: Join us in person at 5:30pm or online at 6:30pm (link to be provided to attendees).

Join us for discussion, food, appsec news, and an OWASP-related talk.

This month Matt Brown from Endor Labs will be joining us to discuss, The Dark Side of Open Source Productivity: There is a dark side to productivity with open source. In modern applications, the majority of code on which an application is built isn’t code written by your team. Modern applications are built on the backs of volunteer communities and open-source software. These volunteers and their software delivery practices all become potential attack vectors. The truth is that most organizations do not factor open-source supply chain attacks into their organization’s threat models today. Security incidents such as the CodeCov bash uploader script, the npm colors, and faker intentionally introduced malicious commits, and the recent PyPi backdoors targeting AWS credentials highlight the impact of supply chain attacks as a scalable attack pattern. To spread awareness on supply chain attacks so that organizations can scalably handle them we propose baking supply chain attacks into existing threat modeling procedures and software development culture so that organizations can champion supply chain management of open source in the places where they are most impactful, at development time. We will present a comprehensive, comprehensible, and technology-agnostic taxonomy of attack vectors, created on the basis of hundreds of real-world incidents and validated by experts in the domain. Following, we will discuss the types of defenses you can put in place to detect and respond to such modern day attacks and how you can work these defenses in based on your program’s maturity.

### June 2023 Chapter Meeting
#### The Risks of Hardcoding Secrets in AI-Generated Code . Julie Peterson

Hybrid Attendance: Join us in person or online (link to be provided).

Join us for discussion, food, appsec news, and an OWASP-related talk.

For our June meeting, Julie Peterson, Senior Product Marketing Manager at Cycode, will be speaking to the chapter about The Risks of Hardcoding Secrets in AI-Generated Code.

Machine learning, particularly Language Learning Models (LLMs), has paved the way for groundbreaking advancements in many fields, including code generation. However, this innovation is not without inherent risks. One potential issue is that these models generate code with hardcoded secrets, such as API keys or database credentials. This practice stands in stark contrast to the recommended way of managing these secrets – through a secrets manager.

In this presentation, we consider the following:
- What are hardcoded secrets and how to prevent them
- The importance of secrets management
- The impact of LLMs in generating code
- How to mitigate the risk of hardcoded secrets in code generated by LLM

This will be an exciting session, RSVP now!

#### Fixing OSS Security Vulnerabilities at Scale with CodeQL · Jonathan Leitschuh

You know what’s cooler than finding one vulnerability? Finding thousands of vulnerabilities all at once! You know what’s even cooler than that, fixing them all at once!

Through the power of your good code you can find other people's bad code and make the world a safer place. Be the darling of bug bounty managers and the envy of security researchers.

We'll introduce the 3 solutions that powered this massive fix: CodeQL, GitHub's code query language that finds security vulnerability patterns at scale, and OpenRewrite, a style-preserving refactoring tool used at Netflix that makes the changes to these problems you found, and a custom built bot for generating these thousands of pull requests.

This talk will take you on a journey through what it means to be an “Open Source Security Researcher” and how CodeQL + Rewrite are serious game changers from the solutions that existed before.

### January 2022 Chapter Meeting
#### Analyzing Source Code For Vulnerabilities: A How-To Workshop · Vickie Li

Writing code is hard. Writing secure code is even harder. Serious security vulnerabilities often stem from small programming mistakes. As developers, we can safeguard our applications by catching these mistakes in our own code.
Performing a source code review is one of the best ways to find security issues in code. But how do you do it? In this workshop, we will first go through the basics of how to review your code for vulnerabilities and some tactics for performing an effective security code review on your application.
But the process of manually analyzing code for vulnerabilities can be very time-consuming. In the second part of this talk, we will also talk about how to use the interactive code analysis tool Joern to make code analysis more efficient. How do you effectively trace user input in code? How can you efficiently link bug sources to sensitive sink functions?
