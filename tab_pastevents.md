### February 2022 Chapter Meeting
#### Insider's Guide to Mobile AppSec with OWASP MASVS · Brian Reed

From the birth of the Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS) and Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG) in January 2018 to the most recent updates, the OWASP Mobile Security Project has advanced the state of mobile app security testing dramatically. As supporters and contributors to the Mobile Security Project at OWASP, we have pen tested thousands of mobile apps and scanned millions of commercial apps in the app stores over the years… and have identified the most common security issues that plague developers and security teams. Whether you are new to mobile pen testing or a veteran looking for the latest tools and tactics, join this session to learn 10 keys to mobile appsec leveraging OWASP MASVS and practical real-world experience.

As Chief Mobility Officer, Brian Reed leads the mobile standards and mobile DevSecOps charge at NowSecure helping orgs deliver secure mobile apps faster. He brings decades of experience in mobile, apps, security, dev, and testing helping Fortune 2000 global customers, federal agencies and mobile innovators. Brian is a compelling storyteller, speaker and writer including OWASP, AllDayDevOps, DevOpsWorld, DevOps Days, RSA, Droidcon, Mobile World Congress, FS-ISAC, and more. Brian is a graduate of Duke University.

### January 2022 Chapter Meeting
#### Analyzing Source Code For Vulnerabilities: A How-To Workshop · Vickie Li 

Writing code is hard. Writing secure code is even harder. Serious security vulnerabilities often stem from small programming mistakes. As developers, we can safeguard our applications by catching these mistakes in our own code.
Performing a source code review is one of the best ways to find security issues in code. But how do you do it? In this workshop, we will first go through the basics of how to review your code for vulnerabilities and some tactics for performing an effective security code review on your application.
But the process of manually analyzing code for vulnerabilities can be very time-consuming. In the second part of this talk, we will also talk about how to use the interactive code analysis tool Joern to make code analysis more efficient. How do you effectively trace user input in code? How can you efficiently link bug sources to sensitive sink functions?
