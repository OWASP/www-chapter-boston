Chapter Meetings â€” Our Fifteenth Year
We now use meetup to organize meetings.

We meet whenever a speaker and a venue have available dates, 6:30 to 9 pm.

Everyone is welcome to come to any meeting, there is no signup or joining criteria, just come if it sounds interesting. You can join the OWASP Boston Google group at https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/forum/#!forum/boston-chapter. This list is very low volume (2 - 3 emails/month); it is used to remind people about each monthly meeting, inform about local application security events and special chapter offers.
