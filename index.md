### May 2023 Chapter Meeting
#### OWASP Kubernetes Top 10 Â· Andrew Josephides

[RSVP on Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/owaspboston/events/292729353)

Hybrid Attendance: Join us in person or online (link to be provided).

Join us for discussion, food, appsec news, and an OWASP-related talk.

For our May meeting, Andrew Josephides, Director of Security Research at KSOC, will give a talk introducing the OWASP Kubernetes Top 10.

Given the growth and adoption of Kubernetes, a number of projects have been published in the OWASP community to help practitioners assess and secure the security of their containerized infrastructure including the recently released Top Ten for Kubernetes (https://owasp.org/www-project-kubernetes-top-ten/). This OSS project is a community-curated list of the most common Kubernetes risks backed by data collected from organizations varying in maturity and complexity. This session will discuss the project in detail, examples for each of the risks in the list, and how to get involved.
